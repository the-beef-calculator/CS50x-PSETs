Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
I thought belgium was going to stay on top. Turns out brazil had something to say about that

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

It seems at the 10,000 mark is probably when more simulations doesn't really yield different results, so 10,000 is where i'd stay.
