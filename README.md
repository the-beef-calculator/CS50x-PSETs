# What is CS50? 

CS50 is a free online computer science course taught by Harvard University! Their lectures are packed to the brim full of information. The course starts off by exposing you to C, in order to really demonstrate 
how many of the functions higher level languages work under the hood (and honestly gives you an appreciation for them when you realize you don't have to code them from scratch every time :') ) then transitions you to Python, and eventually HTML/CSS and Javascript! It is a must-take for anyone considering a career in software development:)  

Please note: Please be careful if you decide to copy any of this code, as the staff at CS50 have stated they conduct
random audits of student submissions, and I wouldn't want you to get in trouble!
